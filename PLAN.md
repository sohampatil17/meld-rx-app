# Clinical Trial Matching Platform - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Clinical Trial Matching Platform, a SMART on FHIR application designed for clinical research sites to match patients with eligible clinical trials. The platform leverages the MeldRx healthcare platform, FHIR standards, and LLM technology to provide accurate trial matching.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **UI**: React components styled with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management
- **Routing**: Next.js built-in routing

### Backend
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for server-side logic
- **FHIR Integration**: SMART on FHIR client (fhirclient.js)
- **External APIs**: ClinicalTrials.gov API for trial data
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API for eligibility assessment

### Deployment
- **Platform**: MeldRx (app.meldrx.com)
- **Authentication**: SMART on FHIR OAuth 2.0

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure TailwindCSS and DaisyUI
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Create environment variables
- [x] Configure API proxies for ClinicalTrials.gov

### Phase 2: SMART on FHIR Integration
- [x] Implement EHR launch flow
- [x] Implement standalone launch flow
- [x] Create patient data retrieval functionality
- [x] Implement FHIR resource handling (Patient, Condition)
- [ ] Test with MeldRx sandbox

### Phase 3: Clinical Trials Integration
- [x] Implement ClinicalTrials.gov API client
- [x] Create trial search functionality
- [x] Develop trial data transformation and normalization
- [ ] Implement trial filtering and sorting

### Phase 4: LLM-Powered Eligibility Assessment
- [x] Design eligibility assessment prompts
- [x] Implement OpenAI API integration
- [x] Create eligibility scoring algorithm
- [x] Develop explanation generation

### Phase 5: User Interface
- [x] Design and implement landing page
- [x] Create patient dashboard
- [x] Develop trial matching interface
- [x] Implement trial details view
- [x] Add demo mode for testing without EHR

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

### Phase 7: Deployment and Documentation
- [ ] Register app on MeldRx platform
- [ ] Complete app metadata for MeldRx marketplace
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Prepare developer documentation
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: FHIR Data Variability
**Solution**: Implement robust data normalization and validation to handle variations in FHIR implementations.

### Challenge 2: Clinical Trial Data Structure
**Solution**: Create a standardized internal data model to normalize the ClinicalTrials.gov API responses.

### Challenge 3: Eligibility Assessment Accuracy
**Solution**: Use carefully crafted prompts for the LLM and implement a scoring system that accounts for uncertainty.

### Challenge 4: Performance with Large Datasets
**Solution**: Implement pagination, lazy loading, and server-side filtering to handle large numbers of trials.

### Challenge 5: MeldRx Integration
**Solution**: Follow MeldRx documentation closely and test thoroughly in their sandbox environment.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of remaining features
2. Test the application with MeldRx sandbox
3. Refine the eligibility assessment algorithm
4. Optimize performance for production
5. Register and publish the app on MeldRx platform
