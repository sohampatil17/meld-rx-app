# Clinical Trial Matching Platform - Summary

## Project Overview

The Clinical Trial Matching Platform is a SMART on FHIR application designed to help clinical research sites match patients with eligible clinical trials. Built for a healthcare hackathon using the MeldRx platform, this application demonstrates how modern web technologies and AI can improve the clinical trial recruitment process.

## Key Components

### 1. SMART on FHIR Integration
- **EHR Launch**: Allows launching the app directly from an EHR system
- **Standalone Launch**: Supports independent launch with FHIR server selection
- **Patient Data Access**: Securely retrieves patient information using FHIR standards
- **Condition Retrieval**: Extracts patient conditions for trial matching

### 2. ClinicalTrials.gov Integration
- **API Integration**: Connects to the ClinicalTrials.gov API v2
- **Trial Search**: Searches for relevant trials based on patient conditions
- **Data Transformation**: Normalizes trial data for consistent processing

### 3. LLM-Powered Eligibility Assessment
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4 to analyze eligibility criteria
- **Structured Analysis**: Breaks down inclusion and exclusion criteria
- **Scoring System**: Provides numerical eligibility scores (0-100)
- **Explanations**: Generates human-readable explanations for eligibility decisions

### 4. User Interface
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive interface built with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI
- **Patient Dashboard**: Displays patient information and conditions
- **Trial Matching**: Shows matched trials with eligibility scores
- **Demo Mode**: Allows testing without EHR connection

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS, DaisyUI
- **FHIR Client**: fhirclient.js
- **API Integration**: Axios
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- **Deployment**: MeldRx platform

## Current Status

The application has been developed with the following features:
- Complete SMART on FHIR launch flows
- Patient data retrieval and display
- Clinical trial search functionality
- LLM-powered eligibility assessment
- User interface for all main workflows
- Demo mode with sample patient data

## Next Steps

To complete the project for the hackathon:
1. **Testing**: Test the application with MeldRx sandbox
2. **Registration**: Register the app on app.meldrx.com
3. **Documentation**: Complete required documentation for MeldRx marketplace
4. **Refinement**: Optimize performance and improve user experience
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the application to production

## Potential Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Filtering**: Add more sophisticated trial filtering options
- **Location-Based Matching**: Incorporate patient location for trial proximity
- **Saved Searches**: Allow users to save and monitor trial searches
- **Notification System**: Alert users when new matching trials become available
- **Integration with EHR Workflows**: Deeper integration with clinical workflows
- **Multi-Patient Analysis**: Support for matching multiple patients simultaneously

## Conclusion

The Clinical Trial Matching Platform demonstrates how SMART on FHIR standards and AI technologies can be combined to create powerful healthcare applications. By streamlining the trial matching process, this platform has the potential to increase clinical trial enrollment rates and help patients access potentially beneficial experimental treatments.
